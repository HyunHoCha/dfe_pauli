# Efficient Direct Fidelity Estimation using Classical Shadows

This program provides a tool for performing **Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE)** more efficiently. It improves upon traditional Random Pauli Measurement methods by partially incorporating recent **Classical Shadows** techniques to optimize the sampling process.

---

## Features

- **Sampling Optimization**:
  - Improves the measurement sampling based on Random Pauli strategies by adapting techniques from Classical Shadows.

---

## Main Functions

- **Efficient Sampling**:
  - Achieves higher accuracy with fewer measurements than standard Random Pauli Measurement methods.

- **Classical Shadows Integration**:
  - Modifies and adapts Classical Shadows—originally used for quantum state tomography—for direct fidelity estimation.

## How to Use

```bash
# Define your target state (functions implemented in utils.py).
